a) Line 1 will run "n" times. So time complexity is O(n)
   Line 2 will run (n-i-1) times. So time complexity is O(n)
   Line 3 is of constant complexity O(1)
     So Total time complexity is "O(n)"

b) Line 1 will run "logn" times. So time complexity is O(logn)
   Line 2 will run "n" times. So time complexity is O(n)
   Line 3 is of constant complexity O(1)
     So Total time complexity is O(logn) * O(n) * O(1)
			       = O(nlogn)
